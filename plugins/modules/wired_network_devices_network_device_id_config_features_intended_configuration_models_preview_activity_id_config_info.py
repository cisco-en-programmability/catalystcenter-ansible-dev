short_description: Information module for Wired Network Devices Network Device Id Config Features Intended Configuration Models
  Preview Activity Id Config
description:
  - Get Wired Network Devices Network Device Id Config Features Intended Configuration Models Preview Activity Id Config by
    id. - > Gets the device config for the configuration model. This API is 'Step 3' in the following workflow. Step 1- Use
    'POST /intent/api/v1/wired/networkDevices/{networkDeviceId}/configFeatures/intended/configurationModels' to start the
    provision of intended features. The response has a taskId which is the previewActivityId in all subsequent APIs. The task
    must be successfully complete before proceeding to the next step. It is not recommended to proceed when there is any task
    failure in this step. The API 'DELETE /intent/api/v1/wired/netwo rkDevices/{networkDeviceId}/configFeatures/intended/configurationModels/{previewActivityId}'
    can be used at any step to discard/cancel the provision of intended features. Step 2- Use 'POST /intent/api/v1/wired/networkD
    evices/{networkDeviceId}/configFeatures/intended/configurationModels/{previewActivityId}/networkDevices/{netwo rkDeviceId}/config'
    to generate device CLIs for preview. The response has a task ID. The task must be successfully complete before using the
    GET API to view CLIs. It is not recommended to proceed when there is any task failures in this step. The API 'DELETE /intent/api/v1/wired/networkDevices/{networkDeviceId}/configFe
    atures/intended/configurationModels/{previewActivityId}' can be used at any step to discard/cancel the provision of intended
    features. Step 3- Use 'GET /intent/api/v1/wired/networkDevices/{networkDeviceId}/configF eatures/intended/configurationModels/{previewActivityId}/networkDevices/{networkDeviceId}/config'
    to view the CLIs that will be applied to the device. Step 4- Use 'POST /intent/api/v1/wired/networkDevices/{networkDeviceI
    d}/configFeatures/intended/configurationModels/{previewActivityId}/deploy' to deploy the intent to the device.
